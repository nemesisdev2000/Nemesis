# Nemesis C2

This is a custom C2 project that I am working on. The Team Server is created using Golang. The Client side GUI is also created using Golang (with the `fyne` framework)

## TODO

- Create a Tcp Listener
- ~~Create console to configure a listener~~
- ~~Make the listener act independently from the server~~
- Show the list of listeners on the Client GUI
- Make mechanism to stop and delete listener configurations
